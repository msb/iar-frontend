<h1>The information asset</h1>

<p>An information asset is a set of information that is held by, and is valuable to, the University of
Cambridge, whether electronically and/or in hard copy.</p>

<p>This may be a:</p>

<ul>
  <li>staff database</li>
  <li>series of paper student records</li>
  <li>collection of teaching materials</li>
  <li>research dataset</li>
</ul>

<p>In this context, ‘the University’ means the Schools, Faculties, Departments, Non-School
institutions, Research Centres / Units and UAS Divisions.</p>

<p>It does not include the Colleges or information assets used solely by students.</p>

<h1>The information asset register</h1>

<p>If we know and fully understand what information we hold we can we protect it and use it to its
potential.</p>

<p>The information asset register (IAR) is a way to record headline information about the
University of Cambridge's most important information assets, especially those that contain personal
data.</p>

<p>In addition, collecting this headline information meets the mandatory record-keeping
requirements of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes law on 25 May
2018.</p>

<h1>Information assets that should be included in the information asset register</h1>

<p>We want to capture headline information about the most important information assets, especially
those that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>contain <a href="#personal-data">personal data</a>, or</li>
  <li>are crucial in enabling the University’s teaching, research and supporting administration,
  and meeting its legal requirements (for example, in relation to financial record-keeping) (link
    to other data below).</li>
</ul>

<h1><a id="personal-data">Personal data</a></h1>

<p>Personal data means any information about a living identifiable individual.</p>

<p>It isn’t limited to what might be considered ‘private’ or ‘confidential’ information about
people. For example, a student’s name and email address are their personal data, as are their
disability and ethnicity status.</p>

<p>Examples of information assets that contain personal data are:</p>

<ul>
<li>departmental staff, student or alumni records</li>
<li>case files relating to users of a staff/student service</li>
<li>submitted work, exam scripts and other exam records where candidates are identifiable</li>
<li>departmental committee records</li>
<li>departmental health and safety records about individual staff</li>
<li>complaint files</li>
<li>the master copy of a research dataset with identifiable participants</li>
</ul>

<h1>Other data</h1>

<p>Examples of important information assets that are unlikely to contain personal data but that
should be included in the register are:</p>

<ul>
<li>a collection of teaching materials (lecture handouts, etc)</li>
<li>the master copy of a research dataset with no identifiable participants</li>
<li>financial reports and papers</li>
<li>teaching quality assurance records</li>
<li>anonymised results of, and reports about, surveys or initiatives</li>
</ul>

<h1>Examples</h1>

<h2>Clinical Medicine</h2>

<h2>Biological Science</h2>

<h2>Physical Science</h2>

<h2>Technology</h2>

<h2>Arts and Humanities</h2>

<h2>Humanities and Social Science</h2>

<h1>Information that shouldn’t be considered an information asset</h1>

<p>A system or application that collects, manages or stores information is not an information
asset, but the information contained within it is.</p>

<p>It is unlikely that the entirety of the content in a records management system can be treated as
a single information asset as the content is likely to cover a diverse range of unrelated topics,
each requiring different maintenance and management.</p>

<p>Depending on the content in the system, records may be grouped into similar types and considered
as a number of separate information assets.</p>

<p>‘Unofficial’ information (such as personal correspondence) shouldn’t be considered an
information asset, despite sometimes being captured on official organisational systems (for
example, email systems).</p>

<h1>Identifying An Information Asset</h1>

<p>When thinking about what is an information asset ask the following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the information have a value to the organisation? i.e.
    <ul>
      <li>How useful is it? </li>
      <li>Will it cost money to reacquire? </li>
      <li>
        Would there be legal, reputational or financial repercussions if you couldn’t produce it
        on request?
      </li>
      <li>
        Would it have an effect on operational efficiency if you could not access it? Would there
        be consequences for not having it?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    Is there a risk associated with the information?  Is there a risk of losing it? A risk that it
    is not accurate? A risk that someone may tamper with it? A risk arising from inappropriate
    disclosure?
  </li>

  <li>
    Does the group of information have a specific content? i.e. Do you understand what it is and
    what it does? Does it include all the context associated with the information?
  </li>

  <li>
    Does the information have a manageable lifecycle? i.e. Were all the components created for a
    common purpose? Will they be disposed of in the same way and according to the same rules?
  </li>
</ol>
